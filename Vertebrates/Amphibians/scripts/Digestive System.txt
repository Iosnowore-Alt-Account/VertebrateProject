Q: How does their digestive system function?
A: Food flows from its mouth to its esophagus to its stomach. Food then moves to the small intestine, where enzymes from the pancreas start the digestion process. From the small intestine, nutrients from the food are absorbed into the bloodstream and delivered to body cells. Food moves from the small intestine to the large intestine before waste is eliminated. Digestive waste enters the cloaca before it exits the body.
